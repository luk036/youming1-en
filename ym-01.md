# A strange case to scare the martial arts worldï¼Œthe head of Beggar Gang vows to catch the murderer

On the tenth day of the eleventh lunar month, the first year of the Xuanhe reign of the Northern Song Dynasty, 1119.

Early in the morning on the day after the winter solstice, every household in Gourd Town was still asleep, except for Brother Ma, who was out on his own as usual. The first snow fell last night, sprinkling a layer of frost and snow on the ground, making the walk seem especially quiet. 

Brother Ma walks slowly, humming a song as he goes:

Calm and fresh from the morning rain in Wei city,
the guest house is green and fresh as a willow.
I advise you to drink even more wine,
for there are no old friends in the west.

This is the song from the Tang Dynasty by Wang Wei called 'Wei City'. Gourd Town was one of the small towns in the Wei City in those years, but today it is nothing more than a slum on the border of Chang'an City.

Chang'an, also known as Xianyang in ancient times, had been the imperial capital since ancient times due to the surrounding natural dangers. However, by the late Tang Dynasty, Huang Chao was in turmoil. Emperor Zhaozong was forced to move the capital, and before he left, he took down all the beams and timbers of the palaces and houses and transported them downstream to Luoyang along the Yellow River. Chang'an was suddenly left in ruins. It was then that beggar clans emerged and became the mainstay of the local social order. In the Northern Song Dynasty, the capital of the empire was moved again from Luoyang to Kaifeng and Bianjing due to the frequent disturbances in the Liao Dynasty. The Beggar Gang also gradually spread its influence to the east and became the biggest gang in the martial arts world....

Soon Brother Ma came to the bank of the Green Wei Bridge, and saw a beggar lying on the center of the bridge from afar. As the saying goes, "The wine and meat at the vermilion gates stinks, but the bones on the road are frozen to death", and this is a scene to which Brother Ma is already accustomed. However, when he came closer to check on the victim, he found that his soul cap had been smashed to pieces and he had died a violent death. Seeing that the deceased had nine brocade sacks tied around his body, Brother Ma thought, "Is he a beggar elder? Thinking of the town's Sixth Shao, who is barely a small crew leader of Beggar Gang, he ran to his door and shouted: "Sixth master, it's bad! Oh, no! Dead man!" Old Shao woke up and said, "The dead go to the government! What do you want with me?" Brother Ma shouted, "It's a beggar elder!" When Shao heard that he was an elder of the Beggar's Gang, he came out to open the door and said to Brother Ma, "Who dares to make a move on Beggar gang? You take me there!" So he picked up his sword, got two disciples, Zhang Fan and Li Sheng, and came with Brother Ma to Green Wei Bridge. When he saw the face of the deceased, he turned pale.

Although Shao is just a lowly member of the Beggar's Gang, but the dead man is recognized, so he said to his two disciples: "This man is the legendary elder of Beggar's Gang, Xiang Dingtian." What happened here last night is now covered by frost and snow, except for the scattered yellow leaves on the trees that are shaking in the wind, citing a duel to the death that once took place.

Shao unbuttoned the deceased's shirt to check and discovered a greenish palm print. Old Shao was shocked: "This strange palm print again!" Li Sheng wondered, "Master, what is this all about?" Shao stood up and said slowly, "Recently, three martial arts masters have mysteriously died under this strange hand. The first one is the "The Master of the Qingcheng Sect" Sima Lin. The second one is Zhuo Yifan, the master of the Divine Sword Sect, and the last one is Shaolin Master Xuan Kong, have shocked the entire martial arts world. Now they are actually moving the grass on the head of the Beggar's Gang, literally declaring war on the whole martial arts world!" Zhang Fan asked, "Who do you think did it, Master?" Shao said, "Who else but the Manichaeans would dare to be the enemy of the martial arts world?" Zhang Fan and Li Sheng asked in unison, "Manichaeans?" Shao proudly said, "The Manichaeans have always kept a low profile, so not many people know them. Recently, they are unable to withstand the oppression from the government and openly oppose the imperial court. It was surprising that more and more people joined them, and they became very influential." As a matter of fact, Shao had just heard it from other beggars, but he was bragging in front of his disciples.

When Shao saw the tragic death of Xiang Dingtian, he sighed and sighed, thinking: "I thought he was a world class hero, but in the end he ended up like this. Half of my life I've accomplished nothing, yet I've managed to live in peace. Alas, I should be content with that." While pondering, Shao heard his disciple Zhang Fan ask, "Master, what are we going to do now?" Shao said, "I have to tell the elders about this immediately. You first use the snow on the ground to preserve his body, and do not alert the government, until I report back to the elders." Shao took a fast horse and headed for Chang'an City. Before he left, he said to Zhang Fan and Li Sheng: "It's going to be busy in Gourd Town!"

The next day, the news of Xiang Dingtian's death has spread throughout the martial arts circles. On top of the helm of Beggar's Gang, there was a sad and miserable atmosphere. A temporary memorial hall was set up in the main hall. Wu Changfeng, the elder, broke the silence first and said: "Three senior martial artists have been killed in the past month. Yesterday, even Brother Xiang was murdered. I don't understand who has the guts to fight against the Shaolin and Beggars." In the midst of this, Wu Changfeng, a former friend of Xiang Dingtian, was extremely agitated. The elder Tian Beishen, who was beside him, said, "Needless to say, it must be the work of the Manichaeans!" Elder Hao Peiliang said, "Among the martial arts circles, the only ones who can surpass Master Xuan Kong in terms of inner strength are the Master of the Manichaeans and our young gang master. But none of them are experts in using swords, so how can they kill the Master of Divine Sword Sect, Zhuo, without a word?" Tian Beishen listened to his analysis, his face paled and shouted, "Elder Ninebag is speaking, how dare you interrupt! You know what the rules are?" Elder Hao was so frightened that he bent down and bowed. But Wu Changfeng said, "What are the rules? We are all brothers in the gang and everyone has the right to speak! What Brother Hao said is true. Last year, I witnessed how Lei Xiong, the deputy head of the Shennong Clan, had his eyes disabled by Zhuo Yifan with his sword. I'm afraid that his sword skills are so superb that only the current Sword Sage, Taoist of Void, can match it." Elder Chu Yuanshan, who was beside him, said, "No! One more! During the sword tournament at Wudang Mountain early last month, the Taoist of Void was defeated by a young man who spotted the flaws within thirty moves!" Wu Changfeng wondered, "Who is this person?" Zhu Yuanshan said, "It's Zhuo Yifan's righteous son, Ye Kouhong! After the tournament, Ye Kouhong disappeared until recently, when he reappeared in Jianghu!"

While they were discussing, the head of Beggar's Gang, Wu Pentao, was lying on the bed, discussing with Jiang Ye, who had just returned from the imperial court. Hu Pentao opened his eyes halfway and said, "Brother Jiang, did Eunuch Li say anything to you? Jiang Ye replied in a low voice, "The other side said it wasn't their people who did it! Eunuch Li says the Emperor has given all the power to the world's No.1 constable Lu Yinghai to investigate this case thoroughly. He also ordered the ministers of the court not to interfere. Eunuch Li told us not to act recklessly."

Jiang Ye is Eunuch Li's informer who has been working for Hu Pentao for more than twenty years. He is obviously Hu Pentao's servant, but he is actually monitoring every move of the Beggar's Gang. Hu Pentao said "I see. Brother Jiang, please help me to the hall, I have something to announce to everyone." As Jiang Ye helped Hu Pentao up, he said: "Master is not well, take care of yourself! It would be better for me to pass on any matter for you." Hu Pentao sighed and said, "This matter must be accounted for by me personally."

As soon as Jiang Ye helped Hu Pentao into the hall, he heard Elder Zhu Yuanshan say, "The Jianghu have been calm for many years, but suddenly such a strange thing happened! The matter has caused panic. Recently, there have been many rumors in the Jianghu that the gang master and the imperial court have conspired to do it..." At that moment, Zhu Yuanshan suddenly noticed Hu Pentao behind him, so he turned around and said, "What a nonsense!" When they saw him coming out, they knew there must be an important announcement. So some people supported him while others stood aside.

Hu Pentao says, "Brother Jiang, please send an invitation to the Qingcheng Sect, the Divine Sword Sect, and Lu Yinghai to Gourd Town and discuss how to find out the real culprit." Jiang Ye replied, "Don't worry Master, I'll get right on it!" When Jiang Ye was far away, Hu took out the 'Dragon Head Staff', a token of the gang master, and kneeled under the spirit of the past gang master. He cried out, "I am incompetent and ashamed of the past gang masters!" After kowtowing ten times, he was bleeding profusely. All of them knelt down and said, "Please don't do that, Master." Hu ignores this and says, "I, Hu Pentao, solemnly swear that if anyone can find out who killed Elder Xiang, I will pass the title of gang master to him! Resolve not to break your word!" As soon as the words were spoken, the crowd immediately started to whisper in each other's ear. Jiang Ye, who has been listening to the rumors, is in a cold sweat. He is shocked and sweats profusely. He was determined to pretend not to know, but he thinks that Eunuch Li will blame himself. He was at a loss as to what to do when Zhu Yuanshan asked, "Does Young Master know about this?"

Tao Jun, the young master of the Beggar's Gang, joined the Beggar's Gang since he was a child, it can be said that he grew up on the milk of the Beggar's Gang and was loyal and devoted to the Beggar's Gang. Five years ago, Hu had already planned to pass the position of gang leader to him.  To Hu's surprise, Tao Jun was in a hurry to reform before he took the position, which caused a lot of discontent among his old ministers. In a fit of rage, Hu Pentao refused to surrender his position as the leader of the Beggar's Gang. In order to protect himself, Tao Jun could only form another gang, and the Beggars' Association was then divided into the old and new gangs.

Wu Changfeng thought: "What kind of medicine is in Master's bottle? But as long as he can avenge the death of Brother Xiang, what's wrong with that?" So he said, "In order to unite the Beggar's Gang, the Master has decided this method of passing on the throne, it can be seen that his intention is good!" The new party's Zhu Yuanshan asked, "Old Master, passing on the throne is a big deal, it's better to wait for Young Master to come back and make plans. We haven't seen Young Master for over a month!" Wu Changfeng said, "Young Master is preparing for an alliance against the Khitan, so he has no time to spare. The most urgent task is to find the murderer who killed Brother Xiang as soon as possible, since the Master has sworn an oath, who is there to disobey?" All the elders of the Beggars' Association agreed to the passing of the throne in order to avoid internal conflicts in the Beggars' Association. In order to avoid internal conflict in the Beggars' Association, all the other elders agreed to this way of passing on the throne. In order to avoid an internal conflict in the Beggars' Association, all the other elders agreed to the passing of the throne.

Hu Pentao felt that's all settled, he took a few steps and suddenly his eyes turned white and collapsed on the ground. The crowd went to the rescue but saw that Wu had lost his breath. Jiang Ye could not stand the sight any longer and ran to Hu Pentao, kneeling down and crying. After more than twenty years of love and killing each other, Jiang Ye's story ends up like this.
