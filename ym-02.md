# Fang Jun observes the sky at midnight, and the Bishop asks about the case

On the twelfth day of the eleventh lunar month

On the third day after the winter solstice, the Manichaeans were waiting at the main altar for the end of closed door training of Bishop Fang La. The Manichaeans are divided into the right and left envoys of light and the four protectors. Protector of The Southern Heaven, Zhu Jingpeng, who had a celestial appearance, was an expert in astronomy and mathematics, and was always very predictable. Protector of The Northern Hell, Xuan Bin, is a short, hunchbacked man who is good at using poison and medicine, and lives and dies by his thoughts. Protector of The Western Mountain, Bai Mengbiao, is a man of supernatural power and is good at wild battles. Pang Qing, Protector of the Eastern Sea, is agile as a dragon and is good at water battles.

Since the Manichaeans were becoming more and more powerful, the followers of the Manichaeans compiled a list of the two orbs and the four signs and 28 constellations in the heavenly bodies.The four protectors of the Dharma are in charge of the four palaces according to four directions: east, south, west, and north, and each palace is in charge of seven constellations.

In the south, the Vermilion Bird was in charge of the well, the ghost, the willow, the star, the Zhang, the wings, and the joint; in the north, the Xuanwu was in charge of the Dou, the Bull, the female, the Xu, the danger, the room, and the wall; in the west, the White Tiger was in charge of the Ku, Lou, the stomach, the Pleiades, the Bi, the Bi, the Shen, and the East, the Green Dragon was in charge of the horn, the hyper, the dizi, the room, the heart, the tail, and the Kei.  Each of the seven nodes is divided into levels according to wood, metal, earth, sun, moon, fire and water.

At that time, Bishop Fang La had a grown-up daughter named Fang Jun, who was extremely smart. Since the Manichaeism stipulates that the martial arts cannot be passed on to others, all the martial arts of Fang Jun are taught by Miao Ruoshuang, the right-handed ambassador of the Light. Fang Jun is an expert in "Flying on the Grass" and has been investigating cases since she was a child. She is good at solving all kinds of cases. Since Fang La has been practicing in retreat for more than a month, Jun takes this opportunity to investigate cases. Miao Ruoshuang is the right-hand ambassador of Guangming, but she usually ignores the teaching. A few days ago, they returned.

That night, when Fang Jun was out for a walk, she bumped into the Dharma King Zhu Jingpeng, who was watching the sky at night. When Zhu Jingpeng saw Fang jun, he asked, "Why did you come late at night, jun? Fang Jun said, "I couldn't sleep and took a walk, didn't I disturb Uncle Zhu? Zhu Jingpeng said, "How dare you, how dare you. You are worried about the Bishop so you can't sleep, right?" Fang Jun nodded his head and said, "Originally, Dad said that he would leave the country before the winter solstice, but I don't know if something has happened. Recently, there was another bizarre case, so I'm a little worried." Zhu Jingpeng consoled, "There's no need to worry, God has his own plans." Pointing to the east, he said, "Look! A particularly bright star over there." Fang Jun looked up and followed his finger, and saw that the eastern night sky was dotted with stars, and she did not know which one was which. Zhu Jingpeng said, "There are three bright stars lined up together in a straight line in the eastern part of the sky." After a while, Fang Jun said, "I can see them. See!" Zhu Jingpeng said, "In these three days after the winter solstice, the sun rises from the ground where the four stars line up in a straight line. It represents the end of darkness and the beginning of the end. After that, the sun will move northward every day until the summer solstice next year, when it will move southward again. God never makes a mistake."

Fang Jun suddenly sighed: "The way of heaven is constant, but the way of the world is unpredictable!" Zhu Jingpeng said, "Are you talking about this strange case?" Fang Jun said: "Exactly! Qingcheng sect master Sima Lin is good at concealed weapons, no one can easily sneak attack him. The beggar's gang elder Xiang Dingtian thirty-two Chen family fist has been refined to pure perfection, no one can be invincible. The swordsmanship of Zhuo Yifan, the master of the Divine Sword Sect, has reached the realm of the extraordinary, how can the murderer kill them without making a sound? Shaolin Xuan Kong master although more than 100 years old, but the internal strength is above the three. This is really puzzling." Zhu Jingpeng said, "Is this matter related to the 'Palace of Ghosts'?"

The Palace of Ghosts is an extremely mysterious organization that has emerged in recent years in the Jianghu area, specializing in selling intelligence. Fang Jun said: "Although the Palace of Ghosts and Master Xuan Kong had some problems, but since the case of 'blood-sucking zither devil' five years ago, they seldom involved in the jianghu. I think this matter has nothing to do with them." Fang Jun remembered how to blend into the Palace of the Ghosts that day and how to escape from death, still have lingering fears. Fang Jun also said: "Brother Lu has sent a letter to me to help him with this case." She refers to 'Brother Lu' is the world's No.1 divine arrestor Lu Yinghai, the murdered Master Xuan Kong is his benefactor. Zhu Jingpeng say comfortingly, "This matter will come to light one day, it's useless to think about it now, it's better to go back to rest."

The next day, the Manichaeism right and left Light Ambassadors and the 28 constellations all gathered at the main altar, waiting for the sect master Fang La to come out. At this time, Fang Jun said to the right Envoy of light Miao Ruoshuang: "Father has been in seclusion since last month, originally promised to come out on the winter solstice, why has not yet seen him come out?" While he was worried, he saw Fang La coming out of a cave in Lotus Peak. Soon, two masked men in black suddenly attacked Fang from behind and hit him twice on the back. Miao Ruoshuang saw that the martial arts skills of these two men in black were no less than those of the four guardian kings, so she was secretly frightened. Unfortunately, the distance between them and him was too far, so they could not rescue him. However, Fang La calmed and relaxed, with a smile on his face, these two palms seemed to have no damage to him. When the men in black saw that the two palms could not hurt him, they did not dare to fight and rushed away. By the time everyone rushed up to the Jade Screen Peak, the man in black had already lost sight of him. Fang La was happy and said, "Fortunately, I have reached the eighth level of my divine kung fu, and I have the body of Golden Vajra." The crowd was amazed to see that Fang had made great progress in this retreat.

After exchanging pleasantries for a while, Luo Junzuo, the Left Envoy of Light, said, "Your Holiness, since your retreat, there has been a strange case in Jianghu. The deceased are the Qingcheng Sect Master Sima Lin, Divine Sword Sect Master Zhuo Yifan, Shaolin Xuankong Master. Five days ago and then beggar gang elders to Dingtian was killed. They all left a turquoise strange palm mark." Fang La was strange: "There is such a strange thing? Find out who did it?" Luo Junzuo said, "We haven't found out yet, but before Master Xuan Kong died, he kept muttering 'God's Palm of the Underworld, God's Palm of the Underworld'." Luo Junzuo said: "Also, when Sima Lin was killed, some witnesses vaguely saw the murderer wearing the Church's shrine costume, the martial arts sects then identified the Church's work, many of the Church's disciples and martial arts sects have been killed or injured each other for this. There are many rumors that the sect master does not take the eight sects into consideration." Fang La was angry and said, "Damn it! Who would have the audacity to frame the sect!"

Luo Junzuo said: "The beggar gang has sent an invitation to the murdered sects to discuss the matter in Hulu town where the elder was killed. Jiang Hua, the next head of the Qingcheng Sect, has sent his female disciple, Sun Xiuwei, one of the four Qingcheng models, to take care of his brother Sima Lin's afterlife. Fang Jun took the opportunity to say to Fang La, "The great monk also asked me to go on his behalf." The great monk that Fang Jun said was the world's number one divine arrestor, Lu Yinghai.

Lu Yinghai is the disciple of Master Xuan Kong, grew up in Shaolin Temple, the Dharma name 'Miao Fa'. Because of the unfulfilled destiny, five years ago and an official family young lady formed a love affair, and finally in the Xuan Kong master's encouragement to return to the lay. With his martial arts skills, he could have afforded to be a chamberlain. Instead, he chose to become a constable! When Lu Yinghai heard the news that Xuan Kong had been killed, he even put aside his wife, who was about to be killed, and rushed to Shaolin at night.

Fang La: "Jun, the murderer came for this religion, father can not let you go to risk." Jun Fang said, "Because this case is related to our religion, daughter should do my part!" No matter how hard Jun Fang pleaded, Fang La still wouldn't allow it. At this time, Miao Ruoshuang said, "Master, why don't I go with Jun, at least we can take care of each other." Fang Jun thought to himself, "Master is usually as cold as ice and frost, but deep down he still loves me!" Fang La was thoughtful for half a day before he said, "I'm much more relieved to have the right ambassador Miao with you. But you have to promise father, everything must be safe as the first priority, do not act alone." Fang Jun said, "It's not too late, then Master and I will start right away!"
