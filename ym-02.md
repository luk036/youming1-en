# Fang Jun observes the sky at midnight, and the Bishop asks about the case

On the twelfth day of the eleventh lunar month

On the third day after the winter solstice, the Manichaeans were waiting at the main altar for the end of closed door training of Bishop Fang La. The Manichaeans are divided into the right and left envoys of light and the four protectors. Protector of The Southern Heaven, Zhu Jingpeng, who had a celestial appearance, was an expert in astronomy and mathematics, and was always very predictable. Protector of The Northern Hell, Xuan Bin, is a short, hunchbacked man who is good at using poison and medicine, and lives and dies by his thoughts. Protector of The Western Mountain, Bai Mengbiao, is a man of supernatural power and is good at wild battles. Pang Qing, Protector of the Eastern Sea, is agile as a dragon and is good at water battles.

Since the Manichaeans were becoming more and more powerful, the followers of the Manichaeans compiled a list of the two orbs and the four signs and 28 constellations in the heavenly bodies.The four protectors of the Dharma are in charge of the four palaces according to four directions: east, south, west, and north, and each palace is in charge of seven constellations.

In the south, the Vermilion Bird was in charge of the well, the ghost, the willow, the star, the Zhang, the wings, and the joint; in the north, the Xuanwu was in charge of the Dou, the Bull, the female, the Xu, the danger, the room, and the wall; in the west, the White Tiger was in charge of the Ku, Lou, the stomach, the Pleiades, the Bi, the Bi, the Shen, and the East, the Green Dragon was in charge of the horn, the hyper, the dizi, the room, the heart, the tail, and the Kei.  Each of the seven nodes is divided into levels according to wood, metal, earth, sun, moon, fire and water.

At that time, Bishop Fang La had a grown-up daughter named Fang Jun, who was extremely smart. Since the Manichaeism stipulates that the martial arts cannot be passed on to others, all the martial arts of Fang Jun are taught by Miao Ruoshuang, the right-handed ambassador of the Light. Fang Jun is an expert in "Flying on the Grass" and has been investigating cases since she was a child. She is good at solving all kinds of cases. Since Fang La has been practicing in retreat for more than a month, Jun takes this opportunity to investigate cases. Miao Ruoshuang is the right-hand ambassador of Guangming, but she usually ignores the teaching. A few days ago, they returned.

That night, when Fang Jun was out for a walk, she bumped into the Dharma King Zhu Jingpeng, who was watching the sky at night. When Zhu Jingpeng saw Fang jun, he asked, "Why did you come late at night, jun? Fang Jun said, "I couldn't sleep and took a walk, didn't I disturb Uncle Zhu? Zhu Jingpeng said, "How dare you, how dare you. You are worried about the Bishop so you can't sleep, right?" Fang Jun nodded his head and said, "Originally, Dad said that he would leave the country before the winter solstice, but I don't know if something has happened. Recently, there was another bizarre case, so I'm a little worried." Zhu Jingpeng consoled, "There's no need to worry, God has his own plans." Pointing to the east, he said, "Look! A particularly bright star over there." Fang Jun looked up and followed his finger, and saw that the eastern night sky was dotted with stars, and she did not know which one was which. Zhu Jingpeng said, "There are three bright stars lined up together in a straight line in the eastern part of the sky." After a while, Fang Jun said, "I can see them. See!" Zhu Jingpeng said, "In these three days after the winter solstice, the sun rises from the ground where the four stars line up in a straight line. It represents the end of darkness and the beginning of the end. After that, the sun will move northward every day until the summer solstice next year, when it will move southward again.God never makes a mistake."
